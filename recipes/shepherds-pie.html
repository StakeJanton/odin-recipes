<p>Shepherds Pie is one of my favorite dishes. It is super tasty and 
    super filling. Most of the time me and my wife actually make 
    Cottage Pie, which is with ground beef instead of lamb, but the 
    recipe is basically the same and you can sub in any protein that 
    you want.</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 large potatoes</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>salt & pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
    <li>1 medium onion</li>
    <li>1 to 2 cups mix veggies (diced carrots, corn, pees, etc.)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>1 cup of broth</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded sharp cheder cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Dice the potatoes and place in pot of water. Set on high heat 
        and cover until boiling. Once boiling, remove lid and reduce 
        heat to a simmer until potatoes are tender. Then drain the 
        potatoes and return to pot. Mash potatoes and add milk, butter, 
        salt & pepper until smooth. Stir in the egg until well combined. </li>
    <li>As the oven is preheating and the potatoes are boiling, you can 
        prepare the filling. Put the oil in a saute pan and set over 
        medium heat. Once this is hot add the onion and mixed veggies 
        for about 3-4 min. Then add the ground beef with salt & pepper
        until browned and cooked through. Add the broth and Worcestershire 
        sauce and stir until combined. bring to a boil and then reduce heat
        to low allowing the filling to cook for about 10-12 minutes or 
        until the sauce has thickened.  </li>
    <li>In a 11 by 7 glass dish, add the filling to the bottom then top 
        with mashed potatoes. Make sure to cover around the edges to 
        create a seal to prevent the filling from bubbling up. Smooth 
        mashed potatoes with spatula then top with cheese.</li>
    <li>Set oven to Broil then put Shepherds Pie in for about 5 minutes
        or until cheese just starts to brown. Allow it to cool before 
        serving.</li>
