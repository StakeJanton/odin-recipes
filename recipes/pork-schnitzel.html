<p>This is another recipe that I have not tried... But I like pork chops 
    and needed another recipe and this sounded really good! Also schnitzel is fun to say. </p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 pounds boneless pork chops</li>
    <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
    <li>lemon wedges to serve</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Trim pork chops of fat and slice into 1/2″-thick cutlets (I used 
        3 large Costco-sized pork chops and after slicing ended up with
        9 pieces). Line a cutting board with plastic wrap, place cutlets 
        in a single layer on cutting board and cover with plastic wrap 
        (this prevents splatter). Pound cutlets with a meat mallet or 
        the back of a heavy saucepan, until 1/4″ to 1/8″ thick.</li>
    <li>Set up three bowls. In the first combine 1/3 cup flour, 1 Tbsp 
        garlic salt, 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp pepper. In the second, 
        use a fork to beat 3 eggs. In the third bowl, add 2 cups panko 
        crumbs.</li>
    <li>Dredge both sides of each pounded cutlet in flour then dip in 
        beaten egg letting excess egg drip back into the bowl before 
        breading in panko crumbs. It helps to use a fork for the dipping 
        process to keep your hands clean. Repeat with remaining cutlets.</li>
    <li>Once all cutlets are breaded, heat a large non-stick pan over 
        medium heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. 
        Once oil is hot, add breaded cutlets a few at a time and sauté 
        3-4 minutes per side or until cooked through. Reduce heat if 
        cutlets are browning too quickly. Remove to a paper towel lined 
        plate. Cut into one to double check doneness juices should run 
        clear. Serve right away with lemon wedges.</li>
