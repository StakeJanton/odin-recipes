<h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Add mushrooms and saute until most of the water from the mushrooms 
            has evaporated and mushrooms are slightly golden, 8-10 min. Add 
            garlic and cook for 1 min stirring frequently. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>To make the filling, combine ground beef, ginger, soy sauce, black
            pepper, green onions and the cooled mushroom mixture in a large 
            mixing bowl. Sir to combine and set aside.</li>
        <li>To make the broth, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a pot over 
            medium heat. Add shallots and cook until softened and beginning
            to brown, about 3-4 minutes. Add ginger and garlic and cook for 
            1 minute, stirring frequently. Add the vegetable broth, soy sauce,
            and red pepper flakes, and bring to a boil, scraping the bottom 
            of the pan as you stir. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered 
            for at least 10 minutes while you shape the dumplings.</li>
        <li>To assemble dumplings, place 1 tablespoon filling in the center
            of each wrapper. Brush the edges of wrapper with water (a spray
            bottle also works well to spray the edges) and fold to shape. 
            Seal each dumpling fully, leaving no open holes. Repeat until 
            all dumplings are filled.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Working in batches, add dumplings to the pan in one even layer 
            and cook uncovered until bottoms are golden, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low. Carefully add ¼ cup water and 
            immediately cover, letting the dumplings steam until golden 
            brown on the bottom and filling is no longer pink at the center, 
            5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the 
            center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Use 
            more olive oil If the dumplings are sticking to the pan.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooked dumplings to a plate; keep warm. Repeat to cook 
            remaining dumplings.</li>
        <li>To serve, place several dumplings in a shallow bowl, then pour 
            over with a spoonful of broth. Top with chopped green onions, 
            sesame seeds and a drizzle of sesame oil.</li>
